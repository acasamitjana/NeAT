# Non-linear fitting for neuroimaging

This software provides the tools to analyze the (potentially non-linear)
dynamics of grey-matter and study the
statistical significance of such dynamics.

## What does this software offer?

Several **fitting** methods, each with its pros and cons, that
let you freely choose the ones that fit the most for your
particular study:

- General Linear Model (GLM)
- General Linear Model with polynomial feature expansion (PolyGLM)
- Generalized Additive Models (GAM)
    - Polynomial smoother
    - Splines smoother
- Support Vector Regression with linear kernel and polynomial feature expansion (PolySVR)
- Support Vector Regression with Gaussian kernel (GaussianSVR)

On top of that, this software includes several metrics to
evaluate the fitting results, such as:

- Mean Squared Error (mse)
- R squared (r2)
- F statistic (fstat)
- F test (ftest)
- Penalized Residual Sum of Squares (prss)
- Variance normalized - Penalized Residual Sum of Squares (vnprss)
